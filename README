enhanced-eval-when provides an enhanced EVAL-WHEN macro that supports
(eval-when t ...) as a shorthand for (eval-when (:compile-toplevel
:load-toplevel :execute) ...), addressing concerns about verbosity. An
ENHANCED-EVAL-WHEN alias is also supported, as well as an EVAL-ALWAYS
macro and package nickname, for good measure.

As EVAL-WHEN with all situations specified is used an overwhelming
majority of the time by most users, these shorthands can really come
handy.


The recommended way to use enhanced-eval-when is to put
(:shadowing-import-from #:enhanced-eval-when #:eval-when) in one's
DEFPACKAGE.

For those who would object to such shadowing, two alternatives are:

(:import-from #:enhanced-eval-when #:enhanced-eval-when)
;; and
(:import-from #:eval-always #:eval-always)
;; The name used for ASDF is still enhanced-eval-when.

As always, it's also possible to fully qualify symbols instead, with:
enhanced-eval-when:eval-when
e-eval-when:eval-when
eval-always:eval-always

Don't (:use)!
