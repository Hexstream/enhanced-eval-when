enhanced-eval-when provides an enhanced EVAL-WHEN macro that supports
(eval-when t ...) as a shorthand for (eval-when (:compile-toplevel
:load-toplevel :execute) ...), addressing concerns about verbosity. An
ENHANCED-EVAL-WHEN alias is also supported, as well as an EVAL-ALWAYS
macro and package nickname, for good measure.

As EVAL-WHEN with all situations specified is used an overwhelming
majority of the time by most users, these shorthands can really come
handy!
