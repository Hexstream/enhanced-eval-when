enhanced-eval-when provides an enhanced EVAL-WHEN macro that supports
(eval-when t ...) as a shorthand for (eval-when (:compile-toplevel
:load-toplevel :execute) ...), addressing concerns about verbosity.

As EVAL-WHEN with all situations specified is used an overwhelming majority
of the time by most users, this shorthand can really come handy!
